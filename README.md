# RevengeOnFreddy

Developer: Tiger
Project designed for Hack112, 2022 Spring.

###IMPORTANT! Rules and Guide!###

Pygame, Opencv, Mediapipe are required.
Run 'main.py' to start game.

This game is a pseudo Temple Run type game,
but much less developed due to the time limit.
In this game, you will be a running hand and hit Freddy bears on the way.
Your energy displayed at the left-top corner will decrease while running,
and replenish after hitting a Freddy bear.
If you ran into Freddy or you are out of energy, you lose.

The feature of this project is the way to control the character.
You are literally using your hand and waving your fingers to move the character!
Make your hand visible in the camera, with the gesture provided on the screen,
and start bending your index finger and middle finger on by a time to run.
Move your hand horizontally to change the horizontal position of the character.
Stick out your thumb to attack a Freddy bear in front of you. 
Notice that you won't be continuously attacking if you keep sticking out your thumb.

Try to score 15000!
Press E to enable Epic Background Music!
Press R to restart the game.

###From now on, less important for players.###

OpenCV and Mediapipe are used for hand tracking.
No graphics modules are used except for pygame,
so the perspective projection is written from scratch.
All the dumb drawings are down by myself.
